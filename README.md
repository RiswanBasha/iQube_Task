# iQube_Task :

This task deals with recieving a mail from an user when the current date matches with the given CSV file's date which we inserted as an input integerated with DB
and Body of the mail will be the attachments of the particular date.

" import_from_csv.py " is the main file

1. This codebase was completely written by me and I have created a basic CSV file with ID,Date,Attachments for demo purpose.That is the file I have been using through out the task.
2. I have used Sqlite3 Database Since, It is very easy to run in VSCode.
3. Basic SMTP protocol module has been used throughout the project.
4. I have used my college mail ID as my receiver  and my personal Mail ID as a sender .I created a path for my personal ID credentials in environmental variable. So, It is only known for me and accepted for my PC.

Finally, Thankyou for giving me this Task. I have learnt a lot of basic python Scripting concepts. Excited to learn a lot from your support.
